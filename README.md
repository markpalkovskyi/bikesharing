# Bike Sharing Analysis

## Overview:
Task for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Results:

This graph of trip durations show that the vast majority of trips taken on CitiBike bikes are under an hour in length.

This breakdown graph of ride durations, separated by gender, makes it easy to understand who particulary oparates more: (male or female).

A heatmap helps show weekly usage patterns. Heavy bike usage during weekday commute times, and weekend usage is spread throughout the middle of the day. An interesting anomaly is the relatively low bike usage during Wednesday's end-of-day commute. Still the low-usage time in the early morning hours, every day of the week.

This breakdown of number of rides by duration, separated by gender, makes it even more apparent how many more rides are taken by male-identifying customers.

More than 3/4 of the users are Subscribers, who make regular use of the bikes and are a predictable source of income for the program. Bikeshare program users are also predominantly male, at approximately 5/8 to only about 1/4 female. The remaining 1/8 gender is unknown or undeclared.

## Summary:
In conclusion, bikeshare services are remarkably popular in busy metropolitan areas, where occupied real estate is densely packed and parking spaces may be scarce. The user base is made up mostly of male subscribers, providing regular income to the program. More outreach should be done to attract female riders, but male users seem a reliable market. And main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times.
